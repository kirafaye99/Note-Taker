# Note Taker

## Description
This application utilizes Express.js, Javascript, HTML, and CSS to build a platform for users to save their notes to look back on later.
- This application will help anyone who forgets what they need to get done or just needs notes to be taken and saved.
- I created this project to help others keep better track of their notes throughout the day or in general.
- I had a lot of issues when creating this project and most came down to little typos. Currently, the delete function is not working, but that will be something updated in the future.

## Installation
`npm install` in the integrated terminal
## Usage
When you get to the home page, click "get started" then type in your note title and note text and click save in the top right corner. To add a new note, click the plus button. When it gets working, the trash icon next to each saved note will delete that note.
